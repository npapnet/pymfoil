Introduction
============

A repository for **pymfoil**, a program for aerodynamic analysis of airfoils using a code similar to XFoil.

*mfoil* is a Python and MATLAB implementation of the classic XFoil code by `Krzysztof J. Fidkowski`_.

The author of this package is **Nikolaos Papadakis** at the `HMU`_ (member of the `Mechanical Engineering Department`_), and its goals are to simplify the use of *mfoil* through the use of Python.

- Make it easier to install
- Develop GUI and command-line tools to streamline the use of *mfoil* for research and education
