Introduction to Pymfoil
=======================

`pymfoil`_ is a modern, Python-based program for the aerodynamic analysis of airfoils, 
serving as an alternative to the classic `XFoil`_ code originally written in Fortran.

Following the purpose of `XFoil`_, pymfoil is intended for the interactive design and 
analysis of subsonic isolated airfoils. It allows users to:

- Perform viscous or inviscid analysis of an airfoil's performance.

- Modify existing airfoil geometries for design optimization.

- Calculate and plot aerodynamic characteristics, such as pressure distributions, lift, and drag coefficients.
