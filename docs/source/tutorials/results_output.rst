Example of Results window 
=========================

.. warning::
    This is work in progress

This is file that shows an example of the results window of the pymfoil analysis tool.

The analyis is for a NACA4415 airfoil at 2.5 degrees angle of attack with 200 panels, at Reynolds number: 5e+6. 

The results window displays various aerodynamic coefficients and parameters, including:

- **Lift Coefficient (Cl)**: 0.758
- **Drag Coefficient (Cd)**: 0.005841
- **Moment Coefficient (Cm)**: -0.1043

The image displays:

- at the bottom half: the airfoil geometry and ?(The flow lines?)??
- at the top half: (?) the pressure coefficient distribution along the airfoil surfaces .
